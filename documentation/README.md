Adjustments from initial designs were made where there were any accessability issue relating to choices.

### Typography & Iconography

In developing our full-stack Django site, we chose to utilize Bootstrap's default fonts to keep the project scope manageable. By leveraging these pre-designed fonts, we were able to maintain a consistent and professional aesthetic without the added complexity of custom typography.

This decision not only streamlined the design process but also allowed us to focus on core functionalities and features, ensuring we could deliver a high-quality user experience efficiently. Using Bootstrap's default fonts provided a solid foundation for our site's visual identity while simplifying development and enhancing overall productivity.

### Database Schema

Lucidchart was used to create the ERD for Quizards. To satisfy the application needs, models were created for the project. These include:

- **User** (User is created on signup, linked to results)
