![ui image 1](/documentation/readme-images/wireframes-img.png)

- Initial designs produced using https://app.scene.io/ 
- Design rolled back to a simple three page design during the iterative process.

### Colour scheme

Initial colour schemes were produced using http://colormind.io/ colour palette was chosen to be cohesive, while being bright and engaging.

![Colour scheme image](/documentation/readme-images/color-scheme-img.png)

Variables were used within the CSS file to call colours as they were needed:

- Royal Blue: #4A5DE8;
- Burnt Ocre: #FF9F1C;
- Off-white: #F5F5F5;
- Pastel yellow: #FFEA00;
- Charcol: #333333;

Initial colour schemes were produced using http://colormind.io/ colour palette was chosen to be cohesive, while being bright and engaging.

Adjustments from initial designs were made where there was any accessability issue relating to choices.

### Typography & Iconography

In developing our full-stack Django site, we chose to utilize Bootstrap's default fonts to keep the project scope manageable. By leveraging these pre-designed fonts, we were able to maintain a consistent and professional aesthetic without the added complexity of custom typography.

This decision not only streamlined the design process but also allowed us to focus on core functionalities and features, ensuring we could deliver a high-quality user experience efficiently. Using Bootstrap's default fonts provided a solid foundation for our site's visual identity while simplifying development and enhancing overall productivity.

### Database Schema

![ERD Diamgram](/documentation/readme-images/erd-img.png)

Database Schema Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Quizards displaying relationships between feature components saved within the database

Lucidchart was used to create the ERD for Quizards. To satisfy the application needs, models were created for the project. These include:

- **User** (User is created on signup, linked to results)
- **Questions** (Questions model exits in database to store and return questions)
- **Results** (Linked to User)

# Testing

## Deployment

https://quiz-heads-c1d86a4688ff.herokuapp.com

###Connecting to GitHub

To begin this project from scratch, you must first create a new GitHub repository using the Code Institute's Template. This template provides the relevant tools to get you started. To use this template:

- Log in to GitHub or create a new account.
- Navigate to the above CI Full Template.
- Click 'Use this template' -> 'Create a new repository'.
- Choose a new repository name and click 'Create repository from template'.
- In your new repository space, click the gitpod open button to generate a new workspace.
- Django Project SetUp
- Install Django and supporting libraries:
- pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn
- pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
- 
Once you have installed any relevant dependencies or libraries, such as the ones listed above, it is important to create a requirements.txt file and add all installed libraries to it with the pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt command in the terminal.

Create a new Django project in the terminal django-admin startproject <project name>.
Create a new app eg. python3 mangage.py startapp home

Add this to list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py - 'home',

Create a superuser for the project to allow Admin access and enter credentials: python3 manage.py createsuperuser

## Migrate the changes with commands: python3 manage.py migrate

An env.py file must be created to store all protected data such as the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY. These may be called upon in your project's settings.py file along with your Database configurations. The env.py file must be added to your gitignore file so that your important, protected information is not pushed to public viewing on GitHub. 

For adding to env.py:

import os
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<copiedURLpostGres>"
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="my_super^secret@key"
For adding to settings.py:

import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.exists("env.py"):
import env
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') (actual extracted to variable within env.py)

Replace DATABASES with:
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }

Set up the templates directory in settings.py:

Under BASE_DIR enter TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, ‘templates’)
Update TEMPLATES = 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR] with:
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates'),
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates', 'allauth')

Create the media, static and templates directories in the top level of the project file in the IDE workspace.

A Procfile must be created within the project repo for Heroku deployment with the following placed within it: web: gunicorn ecommerce.wsgi

Make the necessary migrations again.
Postgres SQL
A new database instance was created on Postgres SQL for the project.

From your user dashboard, retrieve the important 'postgres://....' value. Place the value within your DATABASE_URL in your env.py file and follow the below instructions to place it in your Heroku Config Vars.

## Heroku Deployment

To start the deployment process , please follow the below steps:

Log in to Heroku or create an account if you are a new user.

Once logged in, in the Heroku Dashboard, navigate to the 'New' button in the top, right corner, and select 'Create New App'.

Enter an app name and choose your region. Click 'Create App'.

In the Deploy tab, click on the 'Settings', reach the 'Config Vars' section and click on 'Reveal Config Vars'. Here you will enter KEY:VALUE pairs for the app to run successfully. The KEY:VALUE pairs that you will need are your:

DATABASE_URL:postgres://...
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC of value '1' (N.B Remove this Config Var before deployment),
SECRET_KEY and value
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY and value
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET and value
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME and value
Add the Heroku host name into ALLOWED_HOSTS in your projects settings.py file -> ['herokuappname', ‘localhost’, ‘8000 port url’].

Once you are sure that you have set up the required files including your requirements.txt and Procfile, you have ensured that DEBUG=False, save your project, add the files, commit for initial deployment and push the data to GitHub.

Go to the 'Deploy' tab and choose GitHub as the Deployment method.

Search for the repository name, select the branch that you would like to build from, and connect it via the 'Connect' button.

Choose from 'Automatic' or 'Manual' deployment options, I chose the 'Manual' deployment method. Click 'Deploy Branch'.

Once the waiting period for the app to build has finished, click the 'View' link to bring you to your newly deployed site. If you receive any errors, Heroku will display a reason in the app build log for you to investigate. DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC may be removed from the Config Vars once you have saved and pushed an image within your project.
